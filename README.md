# Hi, I’m Hala 👋

I’m a **Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo** with a strong interest in **software systems, medical technology, and human-centered design**. I’m driven by building technology that has real-world impact, especially in healthcare and accessibility.

I enjoy learning how complex systems come together; from sensors and hardware to software logic and user experience, and I’m continuously developing my technical skills through projects and team-based work.
